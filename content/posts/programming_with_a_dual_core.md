When we search on YouTube about [programming desk setups](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=programming+desk-setups)
![something_went_wrong](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--d9DwF3rS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/v6jpqipu1iu9fo11cnif.png)
this isn't the result for sure, go and search for yourself!.

Got amazed by those _ultra-wide, vertical, dual or triple monitors with a MacBook, XPS or a custom build high-end PC on the side placed on standing desks followed by ergonomic chairs._

If you are someone **with an outdated PC or a Chromebook here are some awesome lightweight replacement for heavy IDE or dev tools that can run on your browser only.**

Well, for a browser I would recommend **Firefox** over Chrome 'cuz it doesn't crash that frequent, are lightweight and provide decent dev-tools or you can use Microsoft Edge which is a chromium-based browser and is pretty similar to chrome and will give less strain to your PC.
![Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/media/img/firefox/home/master/browsers-mr1.1014465d3b4a.jpg)

## IDE
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a comparable heavy software like video or photo editing software which uses high CPU, memory and disk usage.
![Vs Code](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DhgaGpb---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/nph66rgwfby2fjctpgam.png)

Here are some websites that provide the same features as an ide with decent auto-completion.

## [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)
It is a pretty popular in-browser IDE focused on rapid web-dev. It supports web frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, Express Js, etc. It can connect to your GitHub so you can pull and push to your remote repositories. It has a paid version which offers nice features. Using this can fasten your website deployments and increase your GitHub repositories.

## [CodeSandBox](http://codesandbox.io/)
![Code Sand Box](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HPDdkasZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/qia8j0718i9vljpbe1qf.png)
Codesandbox is another ide that offers tools for web dev instead of just static web apps it can be used to make full-stack web-apps or components.

You can create a workspace and can invite people to it to enjoy real-time development which is can't and efficient and it offers the same feature as VS Code Live-Share extension.

## [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)
![Glitch Text Editor](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qqtdq7s0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/aug485492no8d46ssajf.png)
It offers a colourful text editor for making web apps more easily. You can enjoy live coding experience in a colourful text editor.

It features your web apps on a play store like web apps store which features creative and useful web apps and games by no professionals but developers like you. It has got nice community support for using glitch and the language also.

## [Repl](http://repl.it/)
![Repl.it text editor](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C1FxCbwI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/2bj69hsmi3w72a1rb5xv.png)
This is something which can be recommended as a full replacement for an IDE which not only features web development tools ðŸ”§ but also supports languages like Clojure, Haskell, Javascript, Node JS, Deno, C, C++, C#, Django, React and many more.

It also provides support for using Repl and its integrations and vs code intelligence. It provides support for _Version Control_, _Package Manager_, _Terminal Support_.

## Conclusion
I know it's difficult to code and keep your coding dreams alive with such problems but...

> The Drive to code is a prerequisite to be a developer.
